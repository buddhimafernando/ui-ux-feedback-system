UX HEURISTIC EVALUATION REPORT
======================================================================

**Overall UX Score: 7.7/10**


======================================================================
VIOLATIONS FOUND (3)
======================================================================


MEDIUM Severity (2):
----------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Visibility of system status
   Issue: Ambiguous status representation for currency/points.
   Affected: card (top-right)
   Suggestion: Add a clear label or currency symbol (e.g., '27 Points' or '$27') to inform the user of their exact balance/status.

2. Aesthetic and minimalist design
   Issue: High cognitive load due to excessive color variety and competing visual elements.
   Affected: header, button (Redeem), button (Rate Us), card (MATHS), card (GK), card (SCIENCE)
   Suggestion: Simplify the color palette. Use a single primary color for main actions and neutral tones for secondary elements. Reserve high-contrast gradients for the most important 'Call to Action' only.

LOW Severity (1):
----------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Help and documentation
   Issue: Lack of immediate guidance for an 'Earn Money' mechanic.
   Affected: header
   Suggestion: Include a small 'info' or '?' icon near the points balance or in the header to provide quick access to rules or FAQ.


======================================================================
STRENGTHS (2)
======================================================================

1. Consistency and standards
   The use of large cards for quiz categories is consistent, and the placement of the menu icon in the top-left follows standard Android/iOS navigation patterns.

2. Recognition rather than recall
   Key category types (Maths, GK, Science) are clearly labeled with icons, allowing users to recognize options immediately without navigating through sub-menus.


======================================================================
MOBILE-SPECIFIC ISSUES (3)
======================================================================

1. Color and Contrast [high]
   Issue: Insufficient contrast for the 'Rate Us' button.
   Fix: Change the 'Rate Us' background to a darker blue or the text to a darker color to meet WCAG AA standards (4.5:1 ratio).

2. Typography [medium]
   Issue: The 'Beginner' subtitle text is noted as relatively small, which may hinder readability on smaller mobile screens.
   Fix: Increase the font size of the category difficulty (Beginner) to at least 14sp and ensure it has high contrast against the gradient backgrounds.

3. Navigation [medium]
   Issue: Non-critical actions ('Rate Us') are given the same visual prominence and 'prime real estate' as core functional actions ('Redeem').
   Fix: Move 'Rate Us' to the side menu or further down the page. Prioritize the quiz categories and the 'Redeem' function in the top-to-middle visual flow.
