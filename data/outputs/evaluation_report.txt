UX HEURISTIC EVALUATION REPORT
======================================================================

**Overall UX Score: 4.7/10**


======================================================================
VIOLATIONS FOUND (4)
======================================================================


HIGH Severity (1):
----------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Visibility of system status
   Issue: The numeric value '27' lacks context or units, leaving the user uninformed about their actual status (e.g., is it currency, points, or remaining lives?).
   Affected: container (text: 27)
   Suggestion: Add a descriptive icon (e.g., a coin or wallet icon) or a label next to the number to clarify what the value represents.

MEDIUM Severity (2):
----------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Match between system and real world
   Issue: The use of red text for a wallet balance or score is counter-intuitive and contradicts standard mental models where red signifies an error, debt, or negative state.
   Affected: container (text: 27)
   Suggestion: Use a neutral color (black/dark grey) or a color associated with reward (green or gold) for positive balances.

2. Aesthetic and minimalist design
   Issue: The use of four distinct high-vibrancy gradients (Cyan, Purple, Blue, Orange) within a single screen creates high cognitive load and visual noise.
   Affected: button (Redeem), button (Rate Us), button (MATHS Beginner), button (GK BEGINNER), button (SCIENCE BEGINNER)
   Suggestion: Consolidate the color palette. Use a single primary brand color for main actions and a secondary color for auxiliary actions to create a clearer visual hierarchy.

LOW Severity (1):
----------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Consistency and standards
   Issue: Inconsistent text casing across primary action buttons creates a lack of visual harmony and professionalism.
   Affected: button (MATHS Beginner), button (GK BEGINNER), button (SCIENCE BEGINNER)
   Suggestion: Standardize all button text to either Title Case or ALL CAPS for consistency across the interface.


======================================================================
STRENGTHS (2)
======================================================================

1. Consistency and standards
   The layout follows standard mobile patterns with a hamburger menu for secondary navigation and a clear top-center branding area.

2. Recognition rather than recall
   The main quiz categories are presented as large, distinct buttons on the home screen, allowing users to immediately recognize their options without navigating sub-menus.


======================================================================
MOBILE-SPECIFIC ISSUES (3)
======================================================================

1. Color and Contrast [high]
   Issue: White text on light blue or purple gradients (specifically the 'Rate Us' button) likely fails WCAG AA contrast requirements.
   Fix: Darken the background gradients or use a darker text color to ensure readability for users with visual impairments.

2. Typography [medium]
   Issue: Secondary labels such as 'Beginner' and 'Redeem' are reported as 'small' relative to the screen, which may fall below the recommended 16sp/17pt for mobile readability.
   Fix: Increase minimum font size for secondary labels to at least 14-16sp to ensure legibility on various screen densities.

3. Touch Targets [low]
   Issue: While the vertical spacing is clear, the 'Redeem' and 'Rate Us' buttons are placed side-by-side in the middle-left/right, which may result in tight horizontal spacing.
   Fix: Ensure a minimum of 8dp spacing between the 'Redeem' and 'Rate Us' buttons to prevent accidental taps.
