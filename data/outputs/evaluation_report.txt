**Overall UX Score: 0/10**


======================================================================
VIOLATIONS FOUND (3)
======================================================================


CRITICAL Severity (2):
----------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Visibility of system status
   Issue: The interface provides no information or feedback to the user, as no components are detected. The user is left in the dark regarding what the application is doing or what state it is in.
   Affected: Screen
   Suggestion: Ensure that the UI displays content, loading indicators, or empty state messaging to inform the user of the current status.

2. Recognition rather than recall
   Issue: There are no visible elements, icons, or labels for the user to interact with, meaning there is nothing to recognize. This forces the user to rely entirely on memory or guesswork to proceed.
   Affected: Global UI
   Suggestion: Implement standard UI components (buttons, navigation bars, text fields) with clear labels and icons to minimize cognitive load.

HIGH Severity (1):
----------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Help and documentation
   Issue: In the absence of any UI elements or onboarding flow, there is no guidance for the user on how to use the application or what its purpose is.
   Affected: Global UI
   Suggestion: Provide contextual help or an initial onboarding experience to guide the user through the app's features.

======================================================================
MOBILE-SPECIFIC ISSUES (2)
======================================================================

1. Navigation [critical]
   Issue: No navigation hierarchy or interactive elements (like a Bottom Navigation Bar or Tab Bar) were detected.
   Fix: Establish a clear navigation structure using platform-standard components (iOS Tab Bar or Android Bottom Navigation) to allow users to move through the app.

2. Touch Targets [critical]
   Issue: No interactive touch targets detected, making the interface completely non-functional for mobile use.
   Fix: Add interactive elements with a minimum size of 44x44pt (iOS) or 48x48dp (Android) to ensure they are accessible for touch input.
